						- Avalability - the system is available to the users 24/7
						- Reliability - the system is reliable and can recover from failures
						- Testability - the system is testable
						- Scalability - the system can handle the load and can scale horizontally
						- Security - the system is secure
						- Agility - the system is agile and can be changed fast
						- Fault tolerance - the system can handle failures
						- Elasticity - the system can scale up and down based on the load
						- Recoverability - the system can recover from failures
						- Performance - the system is performant
						- Deployability - the system can be deployed fast
						- Learnability - the system is easy to learn

					<h2>Monolithic architecture</h2>
					<img src="assets/intro/monotithic-fig.png" alt="monolithic" />

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Most of companies have a monolithic architecture.
						- This means we one singple application and the frontend and backend are included in the same application.
						- We have one application that does everything, from connectiong to the database, to rendering the frontend
						ref: https://inviqa.com/blog/decoupled-architecture-how-modernise-your-frontend
						- Limitations:
						- problematic to scale and maintain
						- difficult to deploy
						- difficult to test
						- difficult to understand

					<h3>Frontend and Backend split</h3>
					<img src="assets/architecture/frontend-backend.jpeg" alt="frontend backend" />
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- We can split the frontend and backend in 2 different applications
						- This is a good start but we still have a monolithic architecture
						- The communication between the frontend and backend is done via HTTP or websockets
						- We can choose different technologies for the frontend and backend
						- We can scale the frontend and backend independently
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h3>Microservices / Micro frontends</h3>
					<img src="assets/architecture/micro-frontends.webp" alt="micro frontend / microservices" width="70%" />
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- We can split the frontend and backend in multiple applications
						- Each application is independent and own by a team

					<h2>What are micro frontends?</h2>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Do you know when the term micro frontends was first used?
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The term Micro Frontends first came up in
						<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends">ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a>
						at
						the
						end of 2016. By a radom guy on the internet
					</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- he was a random guy
						- Micro frontends are a way of breaking up large frontend applications into smaller, more manageable
						- It extends the concepts of micro services to the frontend world.

					<h2>What are micro frontends?</h2>
					<p>
						Small frontend applications that are composed into a bigger application and each small application is
						deployable independently.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why micro frontends?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Incremental upgrades</li>
						<li class="fragment">Faster delivery</li>
						<li class="fragment">More scalable organisations with decoupled, autonomous teams</li>
						<li class="fragment">Reducer scope</li>
						<li class="fragment">Independent deployments</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Incremental upgrades:
						- Incremental upgrades: We are able to upgrade a part of the application without affecting the rest of the application
						- Incremental upgrades:: smaller, more cohesive and maintainable codebases
						- Incremental upgrades:: If we are talking about dependency upgrade, we can upgrade only the part that needs the upgrade
						- More scalable organisations with decoupled, autonomous teams:
						- More scalable organisations: We can have multiple teams working on the same application
						- More scalable organisations: Each team can work on a different part of the application
						- More scalable organisations: Each team can use a different technology stack
						- More scalable organisations: Each team can deploy their part of the application independently
						- Reducer scope
						- Reducer scope: its more easy to understand a small codebase for new developers
						- Reducer scope: its more easy to maintain a small codebase
						- Reducer scope: its more easy to test a small codebase
						- Independent deployment:
						- Independent deployment: We can deploy each part of the application independently and at a different time
						- Independent deployment: rollbacks independently
						- Independent deployment: We can have separate CI/CD
