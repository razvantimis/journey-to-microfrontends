					<h2>Monolithic architecture</h2>
					<img src="assets/intro/monotithic-fig.png" alt="monolithic" />

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Most of companies have a monolithic architecture. 
						- This means we one singple application and the frontend and backend are included in the same application.
					</aside>

					<h3>1.1 Independent deployments</h3>
					<p>
						Each team can deploy their part of the application independently. This is a huge win for teams that
						operate independently and want to move fast.

				<h2>What is a micro frontend?</h2>
				<section>
					1.1 similiar to microservices
					1.2 Like youtube embedded video or an iframe from other website
					1.3 The term Micro Frontends first came up in
					<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends">ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a> at
					the
					end of 2016. It extends the concepts of micro services to the frontend world.
