## Introduction to micro frontends
Explain what micro frontends are, how they differ from traditional monolithic frontends, and why they are becoming more popular.

## Evolution of software architecture

### Monolithic applications
In a monolithic application, all of the features are tightly coupled together, which makes it difficult to scale, maintain, develop, deploy, test, monitor, and debug the application.
People usually use php frameworks (laravel), ruby on rails, python (django), etc. to build monolithic applications.


Let start with an example, imagine you are building an e-commerce website that has several different features, such as a product catalog, a shopping cart, and a checkout process . Traditionally, you would build all of these features into a single monolithic application, which would then be deployed as a single unit. However, this approach has several drawbacks:
- It is difficult to scale the application, as all of the features are tightly coupled together.
- It is difficult to maintain the application, as any changes to one feature can have unintended consequences for other features.
- It is difficult to develop the application, as all of the developers working on the application need to be familiar with all of the features.
- It is difficult to deploy the application, as any changes to one feature require the entire application to be redeployed.
- It is difficult to test the application, as all of the features need to be tested together.
- It is difficult to monitor the application, as all of the features need to be monitored together.
- It is difficult to debug the application, as all of the features need to be debugged together.
